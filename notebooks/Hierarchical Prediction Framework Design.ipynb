If we are able to map the model to locate where and how certain representations of the system are made, they may be able to be influenced at that point to case the whole system to map a change at that point to the rest of the system (changing necessary outputs to affect neccessary inputs). Another option is dedicate input channels which through learning the system can automate the process of mapping the control input channels "
